/WORK IN PROGRESS/

This is a library for communicating with the BEAM from Zig. It is a wrapper
around ~libei~, which is provided with Erlang, and currently targets Zig version
~0.13.0~.

Note that ~libei~ is not currently packaged for Zig, so users of Zerl will need
to provide the dependency themselves.

Please refer to [[doc/types.org][this document]] for how types are translated
between Zig and Erlang.
