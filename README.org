/WORK IN PROGRESS/

This is a library for communicating with the BEAM from Zig. It is a wrapper
around ~erl_interface~, which is provided with Erlang, and currently targets Zig version
~0.13.0~.

Note that ~erl_interface~ is not currently packaged for Zig, so users of Zerl will need
to provide the dependency themselves.

Please refer to [[doc/types.org][this document]] for how types are translated
between Zig and Erlang.

** Roadmap

*** 0.1 [0/3]
- [ ] Add unit tests for the decoder and encoder.
- [ ] Allow parsing tagged tuples with multiple items from Erlang into Zig tagged unions.

*** Before 1.0 [0/2]
- [ ] Expose the timeout version of the networking functions from ~erl_interface~.
- [ ] Remove all hidden allocations from the library.
- [ ] Either package ~erl_interface~ and add it to ~build.zig.zon~, or drop the dependency entirely.

** Examples

See the [[./examples]] directory for some code examples. If you are looking for a
non-trivial example, check [[https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/lyceum][Lyceum]], it's a game built around this library.

** Developing
