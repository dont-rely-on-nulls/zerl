* Zerl Examples

In order to run these examples, you must have both Zig and Erlang installed.
If you're running Nix, you can grab them using the flake in this repository
with ~nix develop --impure~.

~cd~ into the example you wish to run, then start the Erlang node with:

#+begin_src sh
zig build server
#+end_src

And then run the Zig client with:

#+begin_src sh
zig build client
#+end_src
